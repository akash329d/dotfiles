# dotfiles

Terminal Config/Setup Scripts.

Depends on [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) for plugin/dotfiles management. Run `dfu` to update dotfiles/plugins once installed.

Must have ZSH installed as a prerequisite. 

### Installation

```console
curl -sL --proto-redir -all,https https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akash329d/dotfiles/main/setup.zsh | zsh
```
